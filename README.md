# IP Address
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.
There are four types of IP addresses:  
**Public.**  
**Private.**  
**Static.**  
**Dynamic.**  
It is generally expressed in a set of numbers for example 192.155.12.1. 
Here each number in the set is from 0 to 255 range. 
Or we can say that a full IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. 
And these IP addresses are assigned by IANA(known as Internet Corporation For Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
Types of IP Address
IP Address is of two types: 

1. IPv4:
Internet Protocol version 4. It consists of 4 numbers separated by the dots.
Each number can be from 0-255 in decimal numbers.
But computers do not understand decimal numbers, they instead change them to binary numbers which are only 0 and 1.
Therefore, in binary, this (0-255) range can be written as (00000000 â€“ 11111111).
Since each number N can be represented by a group of 8-digit binary digits.
So, a whole IPv4 binary address can be represented by 32-bits of binary digits.
In IPv4, a unique sequence of bits is assigned to a computer, so a total of (2^32) devices approximately = 4,294,967,296 can be assigned with IPv4. 
IPv4 can be written as:
189.123.123.90
Classes of IPv4 Address: There are around 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses and managing all those addresses without any scheme is next to impossible

## Subnet
A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. 
Subnets make networks more efficient. 
Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.

# WebScraping
Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. 
Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. 
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents, including those with malformed markup. 
It creates a parse tree for documents that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.
